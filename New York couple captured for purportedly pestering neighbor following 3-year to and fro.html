McLeggan additionally tweeted an image of a sign that she posted on her front entryway. Among different cases on the sign, McLeggan stated, "My neighbors have been racially bugging me since I bought my home. ...They are currently planting dead squirrels on my property and have advised me to return to where I originated from." The sign finishes, "I live in FEAR for my life at home. You will hear petitions originating from my home. I am sorry for the clamor." 
</p><p>
</p><p>Police have beforehand just recognized an examination was in progress, however would not affirm subtleties on any occurrences. Specialists said in July there have been in any event 45 calls to police among McLeggan and the couple.

</p><p>
</p><p>"He has done nothing incorrectly of a criminal sort." 
</p><p>
</p><p>"Never from my customer's perspective, were there ever any racial angles to the quarrels that they had." 
</p><p>
</p><p>Kolodny additionally rejected that his customers were answerable for a dead squirrel found on McLeggan's property, yet said a sack of canine excrement set by Canarick had been a mishap after she had attempted to throw them into a trash container and missed. He said his customer would not like to go on to McLeggan's property to recover the dung. McLeggan won a $5,000 little cases court judgment over the occurrence. 
</p><p>
</p><p>After the rehashed posts via online media reporting the supposed badgering, outsiders, including a state congressperson, rose up to help McLeggan watch over her home.

"It additionally moved my office to examine this issue since no one ought to need to live in dread of badgering from their neighbors." 
</p><p>
</p><p>McLeggan tweeted her expresses gratitude toward Monday "from the base of my little heart" to Singas following the captures of "her victimizers." 
</p><p>
</p><p>McEneaney and Canarick were charged on Monday, and are expected back in court on October 9, as indicated by the Nassau County lead prosecutor's office.
