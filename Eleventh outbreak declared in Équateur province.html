            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><p>1 June 2020, </p><p><br></p><p>As of late, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) declared its eleventh Ebola fever happening since records began, following the revelation of latest cases of Ebola fever in Équateur province, northwestern DRC.
</p><p>Less than 2 years since the last happening of the malady resulted in Équateur province, authorities have rumored individuals with either confirmed or suspected cases within the town of Mbandaka and close space.
</p><p>The eleventh happening was confirmed simply a matter of weeks before the tenth happening - that lasted nearly 2 years, within the country's northeast - was declared over by the DRC Minister of Health on twenty five June 2020.
</p><p>On 9 June, UN agency proclaimed that there's no link between the tenth happening and therefore the the} eleventh happening; they also established that the virus within the new happening is distinct from that that circulated in Équateur province throughout the country's ninth outbreak in 2018.
</p><p>Current figures on eleventh happening - data as of twenty five June 2020; figures provided by DRC Ministry of Health

</p><p>25
</p><p>CONFIRMED CASES
</p><p>13
</p><p>TOTAL DEATHS
</p><p>Current situation
</p><p>In the more than three weeks since the outbreak in Équateur province was confirmed, 25 confirmed cases, and three probable cases, have been identified across five health zones in the province.
</p><p>&nbsp;
</p><p>Response to eleventh outbreak
</p><p>Responding to the epidemic in the Bikoro and Bolomba health zones of Équateur province, where we have supported the improvement of isolation units in hospitals.
</p><p>MSF medical and health promotion teams are being sent to the field, while coordinating the response with the Ministry of Health’s partners in the city of Mbandaka.
</p><p>We hope that effective means will be rapidly deployed to contain this new Ebola virus outbreak. We urgently need a large-scale immunisation strategy; the availability of specific drugs to prevent the spread of the virus and treat infected patients; and the decentralisation of care and patients’ integration into the public health system as an important tool to improve access and build community trust.
</p><p>
</p><p>At the entrance oBERTS/MSF
</p><p>Summary - tenth outbreak
</p><p>Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) declared their tenth outbreak of Ebola in 40 years on 1 August 2018. The outbreak was centred in the northeast of the country, in North Kivu and Ituri provinces; cases had also been reported in South Kivu, and some across the border in Uganda.
</p><p>During the tenth outbreak, 3,470 cases were recorded; 2,287 people sadly lost their lives. It is by far the country's largest-ever Ebola outbreak, and is also the second-biggest Ebola epidemic ever recorded, behind the West Africa outbreak of 2014-2016.
</p><p>The last Ebola patient was discharged from the Beni ETC on 14 May 2020; after recording no new cases for 42 consecutive days - twice the length of the disease's incubation period of 21 days - the DRC Minister of Health declared the outbreak in the northeast over on 25 June 2020. 
</p><p>Almost six months after the declaration of the Ebola epidemic in northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), response teams on the ground, including Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), are still struggling to gain control of the outbreak. So far, 619 people have been infected with the virus and 361 have died in what is the second-largest Ebola outbreak ever recorded since the virus was discovered in the country in 1976.
</p><p>Unrest diminishes access to healthcare
</p><p>As the number of new confirmed Ebola cases keeps growing, a heightened climate of unrest linked to the recent presidential elections has further restricted the population’s access to health care in and around the city of Beni. Several health centres in the city were damaged during protests. This is making the prompt identification of new Ebola cases more challenging, as remaining health centres become have overloaded.
</p><p>
</p><p>“In this situation people might have no other choice than to seek medical help in health facilities that do not have adequate triage or infection prevention and control measures in place, which makes the risk of contamination higher,” says Laurence Sailly, MSF emergency coordinator in Beni. “We are talking about a population that has endured many years of conflict. On top of that, they are now faced with the deadliest Ebola outbreak DRC has ever seen. The unrest of these past few weeks adds even more to their plight by limiting their chances of finding adequate medical care.”
</p><p>With Ebola, treatment centres alone are not enough. Connecting with the communities and building mutual trust is key to get the outbreak under control
</p><p>MSF expands Ebola outbreak response
</p><p>Since the outbreak was declared on 1 August 2018, MSF has been steadily scaling up patient care activities to tackle the increasing number of confirmed Ebola cases, most recently in the Butembo, Katwa and Komanda health zones. This includes the expansion of the Ebola treatment centre (ETC) in Butembo from 64 to 96 beds, the opening of a new ETC in Katwa – east of Butembo – and the opening of a transit centre in Bwana Sura in Komanda, Ituri province, where new hotspots have been identified.
</p><p>“With more and more cases coming from the city of Butembo, which has a population of almost a million people, it was necessary to set up a second treatment centre very rapidly,” says Emmanuel Massart, MSF project coordinator in Katwa. “We are also addressing the need to gain the trust of the affected communities.
</p><p>The need to increase community trust
</p><p>“We designed the Katwa treatment centre with the aim of offering greater capacity for patient care,” Massart says. “Large windows allow our patients to see the faces of the doctors and nurses treating them and make family visits easier, re-establishing some of the human contact that is so hard to maintain in Ebola treatment centres.”
</p><p>
</p><p>Raising awareness among communities about measures to control the spread of Ebola remains one of the main challenges of the outbreak response and has become largely the responsibility of organisations involved in the response.
</p><p>&nbsp;
</p><p>Reaching communities has become even more difficult as the tension that followed the postponement of the elections in Beni and Butembo has increased the population’s distrust of Ebola response activities. People are now even more reluctant to accept infection prevention and control practices such as safe and dignified burials or the decontamination of health centres and households.
</p><p>
</p><p>“With Ebola, treatment centres alone are not enough. Connecting with the communities and building mutual trust is key to get the outbreak under control”, says Roberto Wright, MSF anthropologist in Katwa. “We need to increase our efforts to engage the community as active participants in the fight against the outbreak. This includes listening to their broader needs. For instance, at the end of December, we distributed trauma kits to local health centres to help their response to potential outbursts of violence."
</p><p>“Likewise, our transit centres are not only there to identify Ebola patients and refer them for treatment, but also to ensure adequate care for other health issues, which is a clear need for these people,” Wright says. “Visiting communities to explain our activities before we actually launch them can go a long way in terms of improving mutual understanding and facilitating better collaboration in the long run.”
</p><p>MSF teams have been responding to the Ebola epidemic in North Kivu and neighbouring Ituri province since it was declared on 1 August 2018. MSF is running Ebola treatment centres in the towns of Butembo and Katwa, transit centres in Beni and Bwana Sura (Komanda health zone), and an isolation centre in Bunia. MSF also helped with the vaccination of frontline health workers and it carries out infection prevention and control activities and awareness-raising activities among health workers and affected communities.
</p><p>
</p><p>MSF maintains complete independence from all political, religious or military powers and observes impartiality in its actions, based on an assessment of medical needs. The independence of the association is ensured by funding, 96 per cent of which comes from private donors.
</p><p>&nbsp;“The bullet passed through the boy’s legs and killed his mother,” says Diop El Haji, MSF’s medical team leader. “He was brought to Drodro general hospital by neighbours.”
</p><p>“Both his parents were killed in the attack along with his three sisters and three brothers,” says El Haji. “Of his whole family, only one brother survived after he managed to escape into the bush.”
</p><p>Health centres have also been targeted by the violence.
</p><p>“On 2 May, the war came to the area of Wadda and left behind over 200 burned homes. The health centre we were supporting was looted,” says Alex Wade, MSF head of mission in Ituri. “Sadly, this was not the first health facility to be targeted. In May alone, at least four other health facilities were reported to have come under attack.”  
</p><p>Ordinary people are the main victims of the fighting between militias and the national army. Many people live in fear of attack, while the violence is also hampering our efforts to provide medical care.
</p><p>“Many people are living in constant terror of being attacked in an area where the humanitarian needs are sharply increasing,” says Wade. “Our teams are struggling to provide healthcare to both local and displaced people because we have no guarantee of safe access to some areas.”
</p><p>
</p><p><br></p><p>People’s access to healthcare is impeded not only by the violence but also by the fear of violence.
</p><p>“The violence is systematically targeting villages and health centres in order to prevent the people who fled from returning,” says Benjamin Courlet, MSF’s field coordinator. “Some people are too terrified to go the health centres that are still functioning in the villages or in the camps. Instead they stay in the bush, so we have set up mobile clinics to reach them there.”
</p><p>MSF is calling for increased support for the hundreds of thousands of displaced people who are sheltering in unsanitary and overcrowded conditions, where minimum humanitarian standards are far from being met. Our teams are trying to deal with people’s most urgent needs, but more aid needs to be provided, including basic healthcare and essential supplies.
</p><p>“In light of the recent conflict, the priority is to reach those people in immediate need of medical assistance, and then to try and improve their living conditions as much as possible,” says Courlet. “On top of that, we have to implement infection prevention and control measures, particularly in view of the threat of COVID-19. People’s needs are huge, and we cannot do everything on our own.”
