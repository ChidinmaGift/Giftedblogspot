</p><p>The 779 daily toll announced on Saturday is Nigeria’s record one-day infection and it took toll past 24,000 mark. As of Sunday afternoon, reports indicated that an Air Peace flight was repatriating hundreds of stranded Nigerians from the U.K.
</p><p>Aviation Minister Hadi Sirika on Saturday disclosed that passengers looking to use local flights will need to be at the airport three hours to take off due to safety guidelines as part of flight resumption.
</p><p>He said in the case of international flights, passengers may even have to be at the airport five hours to take off.
</p><p>He led the COVID-19 task force for a visit to the Abuja and Lagos airports to access the readiness for flight resumption. “We aill announce all the protocols again before opening. But you need to be at the airport three hours ahead of your flight.
</p><p>“The experience is quite nice but it takes a bit of time which is why you will need to be at the airport three hours before your local flight. For an international flight, we might do five hours,” he added.

</p><p>June 26: 22,614 cases; infections definitely higher
</p><p>National coordinator of Nigeria’s virus task force, Sani Aliyu, says the number of cases in Nigeria is far more than has so far been detected. He stressed the need for people to respect containment measures and do all it takes to stay safe and not contract the virus.
</p><p>Speaking at the daily briefing of the task force in Abuja on THursday, he said: “Many countries in the world are fighting this pandemic. Over nine million people have tested positive, not suspicion, but tested positive for the disease and at least 22,000 of them are in Nigeria,” he said.
</p><p>“There are thousands more in our country. For everyone case, there are a handful of cases that we are missing because we are not able to test everybody. The containment measures that were put in place to protect the public, are there to protect the public, they’re not there to swindle them.
</p><p>“No sane country on earth will destroy its own economy willingly. No sane country on earth will take major decisions that they know would be detrimental to their economy. So we’re living in really challenging times and we couldn’t have taken these decisions just on the basis of maybe suspicion that a disease exists.
</p><p>“This disease does exist. Whether we like it or not, it exists. If we want to survive it, we have to start believing in it.”
</p><p>According to Aliyu, if people believed Ebola and Lassa fever without experiencing it first-hand, then there was no reason to doubt the existence of COVID-19 in the country.
</p><p>“We do not need to know someone personally who has died from COVID-19 to believe it is real. In fact, I think it is a disservice and it is insensitive to those families that have lost loved ones for people to continue to claim that COVID-19 does not exist,” he said.
</p><p>“Let us not wait for the virus to reach disastrous proportions before we begin to believe and act. We have already seen this happen in many other countries. We must learn from their experiences to mitigate preventable fatalities.”

</p><p>Nigeria hit the 18,000 mark as of close of day June 18 as deaths reached 475 and recoveries hit 6,307 according to the NCDC.
</p><p>Meanwhile there is what could be described as a flurry of evacuee arrivals in the capital Abuja and Lagos with a number of citizens arriving from across the world.
</p><p>The diaspora commission, NIDCOM, reported on Thursday that an Air France flight departed Paris to Lagos with 15 Nigerians on board from France, Germany, Belgium, Holland and Estonia. They are said to have registered for the evacuation with the Nigerian Missions in these countries.
</p><p>NIDCOM today reported that 50 stranded Nigerians in Pakistan landed in Abuja, at about 01:45 via Tarco Air. Another 300 stranded Nigerians arrived at the Abuja Airport from Dubai.

</p><p>June 18: tally nears 18,000; over 1,700 recoveries in a week
</p><p>Tallies show that 1,761 recoveries have been recorded in one week as COVID-19 toll nears 18,000. NCDC updates showed that 587 new cases had taken the tally to 17,735.
</p><p>Overall recoveries stood at 5,967 by close of day June 17 with 469 deaths. Kaduna State today received mobile testing centers, governor Nasir el-Rufai announced via social media.
</p><p>The state is 8th on the most impacted list with 490 cases so far. “The mobile testing vehicle uses GeneXpert machines for the Covid-19 test. KDSG has imported 9800 of these test kits, the first government in Nigeria to do so. The state is seeking to import 40,000 more to meet its target of 50,000 Covid-19 tests,” the governor added.
</p><p>Meanwhile, the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) says six airlines have passed the airworthiness requirements in readiness for the resumption of commercial flight operations.
</p><p>NCAA’s director for airworthiness standards, made the disclosure during a webinar earlier this week. “Six of the airlines have crossed the mark from the point of view of airworthiness.
</p><p>“We have asked all the airlines that they should use only reagents that are approved by the original equipment manufacturers of their different aircraft types to disinfect their machines,” Ita Awak said.
</p><p>The tentative date for the resumption of domestic flights in the country is June 21, 2020. Operators are however worried about restrictions on the number of passengers that they will be allowed to carry in the light of physical distancing rules.
</p><p>Samson Fatokun, West Africa area manager of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), warned that airlines would not break even with the proposed 70 percent load factor. Airlines are expected to keep their middle seats empty.
</p><p>Allen Onyeama, CEO of Air Peace airline, summed up the headache for airlines who he says would likely have to transfer costs to other passengers.
</p><p>“If you want to now distribute the cost on the few people who are flying, about 50 percent or 70 percent who are flying, maybe an aircraft of about 140-seater, you are flying only 90 people, you have to distribute the other seats not being flown on the passengers

</p><p>June 17: 17,148 cases; govt hails role of media
</p><p>The government has underlined the centrality of the media’s role in combating the COVID-19 pandemic. Information Minister Lai Mohammed, however, appealed for more support.
</p><p>He was speaking on Tuesday in a virtual meeting with the Newspaper Proprietors’ Association of Nigeria (NPAN). ”The government is very grateful to the media. You have done a lot to bring our message (on the pandemic) to Nigerians,” he said.
</p><p>He cited a poll that said 99% of Nigerians are aware of the pandemic while 95% had received information on how to protect themselves.
</p><p>According to the minister, the sole preventive option available remained the Non Pharmaceutical Intervention (NPI), so long as the search for a drug and vaccine continued. He urged citizens to practice physical distancing, wearing of face mask, and avoiding mass gathering whiles ensuring personal hygiene.
</p><p>“You see, the truth of the matter is that as long as there is no vaccine or drug for Covid-19, the only way we can all survive is through the Non Pharmaceutical Intervention, which is actually anchored on advocacy and public sensitization and there is no way you can do this without the media in whatever form, whether it is the print, electronic or the New Media.
</p><p>“Yes we are going to spend more on research and ventilators but we will spend less money on ventilators, less on isolation centres if we invest just a fraction of what we are spending on ventilators in the media,” the Minister added.
</p><p>Meanwhile cases reached 17,148 as of close of day June 16. Testing has increased to almost 100,000 samples, NCDC records say. A paltry sum compared to South Africa’s over 1.1 million tests till date.

</p><p>“I think that the federal government will be excited to encourage the resumption of schools because obviously the coronavirus has come to stay with us and the reality is that countries that have attempted to resume schools have had to contend with the increasing prevalence of the virus but obviously how long can we wait as a country?” he asked.
</p><p>“So perhaps, we have to adopt a new lifestyle that will integrate coronavirus as part of our lifestyle,” he added.

</p><p>“We have got about N22 billion that was released to the PTF and just to make it clear, thePTF is not a procuring body. At the moment, that is like 0.002% and the reason why we haven’t spent so much is because of the need for prudence in the first place.
</p><p>“A lot of MDAs are yet to do their procurement and a lot of MDAs are still using their 2020 budgets for their activities and as far as I am concerned, there is no problem here. We are in a pandemic situation so we are making sure that the resources we have are being used appropriately,” he said.
