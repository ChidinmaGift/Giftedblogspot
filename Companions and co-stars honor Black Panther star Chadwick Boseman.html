He murmured that when I got my privileged degree from Howard University, his place of graduation, he was the understudy doled out to accompany me that day. Also, here we were, years after the fact as companions and partners, getting a charge out of the most radiant night ever! We'd went through weeks preparing, working, sitting close to one another each morning in cosmetics seats, planning for the day together as mother and child. I am respected that we delighted in that round trip understanding. This youngster's commitment was dazzling, his grin infectious, his ability unbelievable. So I honor a lovely soul, a quintessential craftsman, a heartfelt brother...'thou aren't not dead but rather flown afar...'. All you had, Chadwick, you unreservedly gave. Rest now, sweet ruler." - through Instagram
